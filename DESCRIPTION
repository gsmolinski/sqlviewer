Description: In RStudio IDE one can connect to database using
    'Connections' pane and then write SQL queries in '.sql' file
    associated with this connection. However, current previewer allows to
    see the result only from one query in the whole file (not possible to
    execute code query-by-query). With 'sqlviewer' it is possible to see
    the results from multiple queries and to combine multiple queries into
    one query using the construct inspired by the pipe operator.
