Description: A 'shiny' app to run SQL queries against provided database
    connection. It supports running more than one query at a time and
    displays results from multiple queries. Additionally, it helps to
    construct complex queries, providing pipe-inspired operator, what can
    be used to improve debugging experience as well (by making possible to
    see results from temporary tables).
